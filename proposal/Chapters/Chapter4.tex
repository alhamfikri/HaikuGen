\section{Project Specification}


In this project, we aimed to build automated Haiku generator. This Haiku generator will take an input of one or some topic keywords from a user, and randomly generates Haiku that related to the keyword.This keyword is not mandatory, the topic will be randomly chosen in a case when a user does not provide the input.


The generated Haiku will follow English Haiku rules as follow:

\begin{enumerate}

\item It consists of three lines with 5,7,5 syllables distribution

\item Using \textit{kireji} is not necessary

\item Using seasonal words is preferable, but not required.

\item Does not consider about rhymes

\end{enumerate}


However, as there is no strict rule of writing English Haiku, we allow a user to customise the output Haiku structure. Therefore, we put the rules above as default rule and user may change it preferences as desired. 

This project will be implemented in Java, thus we expect that it should run on most standard computers. Moreover, Java is operating system independent, hence the application will run on most operating systems. To further enhance the usability, a web-based application will be deployed with a HTML5 client. This application allows people to use Haiku generator without running and installing the Java application, which should be more convenience for people with little technical and computer skill.
