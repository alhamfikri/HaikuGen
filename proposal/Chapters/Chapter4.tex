\section{Project Specification}

In this project, we aimed to build automated Haiku generator. This Haiku generator will takes input of one or some topic keywords from user, and randomly generates Haiku that related with the keyword.This keyword is not mandatory, topic will be randomly chosen in case when user does not provide the input.

The generated Haiku will follow English Haiku rules as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It consist of three lines with 5,7,5 syllables distribution
	\item Using \textit{kireji} is not necessary
	\item Using seasonal words is preferable, but not required.
	\item Does not consider about rhymes
\end{enumerate}

However, as there is no strict rule of writing English Haiku, we allow user to customize the output Haiku structure. Therefore, we put the rules above as default rule and user may change it preferences as desired. 

This project will be implemented in Java, thus we expect that it should run in most standard computers. A Java applet of the project will be developed and further deployed on web platform.
