three strokes of lightning & one hit mountain frightening & dark clouds thunder loud
the leaves change color & fall has fallen once again & the colors so bright
they fall to the ground & to make a bed of beauty & they fall with no sound
their lives are complete & one more journey to their rest & now wait for winter
darkening Shadows & flower drifts to gentle sleep & the world is resting
