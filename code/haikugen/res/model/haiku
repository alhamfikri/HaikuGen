three strokes of lightning & one hit mountain , frightening & dark clouds thunder loud
the leaves change color & fall has fallen once again & the colors so bright
their lives are complete & one more journey to their rest & now wait for winter
darkening Shadows & flower drifts to gentle sleep & the world is resting
haiku is easy & but sometimes they don't make sense & refrigerator !
