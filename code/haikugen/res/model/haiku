strokes of lightning & one hit mountain, frightening & dark clouds thunder loud
darkening shadows & flower tackles to a gentle sleep & the boy is resting
a jar of pennies & on the lemonade stand & evening cool
a mountain village & under the pilled-up snow & the sound of water
a weathered skeleton & in windy fields of memory , & piercing like a knife
the crow has flown -- & swaying in the evening , & a leafless tree
autumn moonlight -- & a worm digs silently & into the chestnut
vagabond sun -- & nothing but ink to nail & my shadow
winter dawn & a butterfly wakes up & in my dream
a fine dust of light –- & the gingko leaf reflected & falling through your eyes
thick blanket of snow & snuggling the flowerbeds & with a frozen wrap
a bit of rust & on the fender & harvest moon
county fair & a ribbon of winner  & in an extraordinary stall
the christmas & after we told them & artificial tree
junky car -- & the hum of bees & beneath the hood
no escape , & this moonlight -— & pompeii
desert twilight & a map with creases & nailed to a cross
all souls day -- & my friends called & from the big gate
cafe for sale —- & outdoor tables rusting & into autumn
crescent moon & a bone carver is singing & to his ancestor
cold snowy field & the earth marked & by fallen angels
tasting the well & in the water -— & summer stars
the moon is broken & battersea power station & from a train window
that hut in the wood -- & i remember it fell & because no-one cared
there was a moment , & between the handshake and smile & long enough to judge
painting your portrait -- & i took wildly and took & the canvas is blank
playing in the snow & in the glow & of the winter moon
flowing river –- & the bereaved girl wakes & a palm of water
blades flying free & we pull the windmill rods & from deep in the rock
bright July morning & a dust cloud tackles me & over the cattle guard
up with the rooster & the boss punched me & shovel out the barn
moving the tarps & down the irrigation ditch & alfalfa in bloom
leafy cottonwoods & i traveled a shady spot & to read the good earth
a leafy cottonwoods & i went to a shady spot & to read the good earth
the sky wakes & and a waterfall wakes & from the void like light
the skies follow & and a waterfall wakes & from the void-like light
cat on windowsill & folding boneless in sunlight & origami wakes
a pain deep inside & the pregnancy has ended & grieve unborn child
stolen poem & took credit for my effort & poem was removed
fragrance of green tea & i sharpened my old pencil & under the moon’s light
leonid showers & the sky continues falling & one star at a time
indian summer & mother wakes her graying hair & the color of straw
war memorial & the shine on a bronze soldier & from so many hands
